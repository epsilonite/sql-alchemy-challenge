# Hawaii Climate Analysis
This challenge has us doing research for trip planning to Honolulu, Hawaii. This is accomplished through a basic climate analysis and data exploration of our climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which is used to then design a Flask API based on the queries we developed.
